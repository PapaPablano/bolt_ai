# Recommendations for Tomorrow

## 1. File Organization
- Review and enforce consistent file naming conventions.
- Organize components, pages, and libraries in a logical structure to improve maintainability.

## 2. Code Quality
- Run linting tools to identify and fix code quality issues.
- Ensure all files adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices.

## 3. Documentation
- Update README.md with an overview of the project and setup instructions.
- Improve documentation files in `docs/` for better understanding and maintenance.

## 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for new components and features.
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage, especially for critical parts of the application.

## 5. Performance Optimization
- Optimize images and assets to reduce load times.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources to improve performance.

## 6. Accessibility
- Review ARIA landmarks in components like `FocusManagementDemo.tsx` and ensure proper focus management.
- Update accessibility guides in the `frontend/src/pages/help/` directory.

### Next Steps:
1. Run linting tools to identify code quality issues.
2. Organize files as per recommendations.
3. Update documentation files.
4. Write unit tests for critical components.
5. Optimize performance by reviewing and optimizing assets.
6. Review and improve accessibility features.
