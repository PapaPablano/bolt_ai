[10 months ago](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65807750/detect-listen-when-visible-price-range-changed-in-lightweight-chart?lastactivity)
So the timeScale in [lightweight-chart](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts) has a way to detect when visible time range is being updated (through subscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange).

```
subscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange
```

My question, is there a similar way to detect/listen when visible price range changed? Gone through the documentation for a bit but couldn't find anything close.
We have a use case where we wanna adjust the price line in area chart when min/max price range changes.
Feedback would be much appreciated!
